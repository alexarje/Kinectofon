## What can it do? ##

The Kinectofon is an instrument for creating sound from a Kinect sensor device. It is based on turning images into [motiongrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motiongram), which are again turned into sound based on an "inverse-FFT-process".

## Usage ##

Connect your Kinect sensor, open the patch, start the video input, start the audio, move to make sound.


## Requirements ##

The Kinectofon is a Max patch, and requires Cycling '74's Max to run.
